# QuickGroup
This addon was designed to help you join carry groups for Mythic+ Keystones or raid groups quickly using the premade group finder. It is currently command based and is very simple to use.

 

The following commands are available:

(/qg or /QG) 

 

/qg set TANK HEALER DPS MODE

 

 

Tank, Healer and DPS are a y or n (yes or no respectively)

Mode, can be set to key, for Mythic+, raid for raid groups, or none, to apply to the group without whispering the leader.

 

If you are using Mythic+ mode (key), the addon will automatically find the Keystone in your bag.

 

Typing /qg id will set the achievement that is whispered to the group leader when using raid mode.

 

Finally, /qg join will apply to the group you are moused over in the Premade Groups window and whisper the leader your, key, achievement or not at all depending on your previous settings.

 

Examples:

 

/qg set y n y key

 

Will set the addon to whisper the leader of the group with the keystone in your bag and queue you as a Tank or DPS.

 

/qg set n y n raid

 

Will set the addon to whisper the leader of the group with an achievement you have picked out from the achievement menu, using /qg id or Xavius AoTC by default without setting and achievement up.
